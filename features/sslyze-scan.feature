      |ECDH-RSA-CAMELLIA256-SHA384            |

#SSL - Strict TLS Header
Scenario: The server should set Strict TLS headers
  #Then the output must contain a line that matches .*OK - HSTS header received:\s+max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains.*
  Then the SSLyze output must contain a line that matches .*Max Age:\s+31536000.*
  Then the SSLyze output must contain a line that matches .*Include Subdomains:\s+True.*

#SSL - Not Support SHA-1 Certificate 
Scenario: The certificate does not use SHA-1 any more
  Then the SSLyze output must contain a line that matches .*OK - No SHA1-signed certificate in the verified certificate chain.*

#SSL - Weak Cipher Suites 
Scenario: Weak cipher suites should be disabled
  Then the following ciphers must not be supported
         | cipher       |

#Certificate Key Size should be 2048 bit
Scenario: The server key should be large enough
  Then the SSLyze output must contain a line that matches .*Key Size:\s+2048.*

#Certificate Should be in valid 
Scenario: The server certificate should be trusted
  Then the certificate has a matching host name
  And the certificate is in major root CA trust stores
